In this project, I used SQL to explore a COVID-19 data set containing information on confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccinations in different countries and regions.

I used SQL to perform various tasks, including data cleaning, aggregation, and filtering. I also used SQL to join tables and perform calculations to derive meaningful insights from the data.
