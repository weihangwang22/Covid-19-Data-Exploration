## Covid-19 Data Exploration

In this project, I used SQL to explore a COVID-19 data set containing information on confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccinations in different countries and regions. The main objectives of this project were to:

* Gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on different countries and regions  
* Analyze the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns in controlling the spread of the virus
* Identify patterns and trends in the COVID-19 data to inform decision-making and resource allocation

Using SQL queries and statements, I performed various tasks to analyzed and manipulated the data to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on different countries and regions.
